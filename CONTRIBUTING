Git Flow
~~~~~~~~

This project makes heavy use of `git
flow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__. If
you are not familiar with it, then the most important thing for you to
understand is that:

**pull requests need to be made against the develop branch**

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end
   of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this
   includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file
   locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md
   to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The
   versioning scheme we use is `SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two
   other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you
   may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

Code of Conduct
---------------

You can find our code of conduct in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file next to
